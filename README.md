# Zyga Engine
## What this is all about

The Forgotten Era is a game engine I'm currently working on. It is built using Python 3. It will feature my own, hand-made game engine: zyga engine. This game  will simulate a (more or less) open world in a text-adventure format. You know? Like the `go left` or `use book` commands used to interact with a console-based world, which offers suprisingly little freedom? This is similar; just offering way more freedom, and as a result, way more complex. It will offer basically everything a classic RPG game offers, but restricted to a command line interface.

Here's hoping that I'm actually able to finish this (and make this look and feel good, but let's not get too ahead of ourselves).

Note that I haven't prepared `setuptools` or any of that shmizz because I want to make this game first before I package zyga engine seperately.

## Can I use it too?

Sure! Zyga Engine uses a MIT License. TL;DR You can use it but don't forget to credit me. 

This all may change. I don't even know if I'm going to release this on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
